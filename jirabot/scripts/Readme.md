This folder contains all the scripts that we write for the bot.
Any bot scripts, things like robot.respond functions and SMALL code blocks, should be in main.js
Any other types of scripts should be in a separate file, to make reading and documenting easier
The kinds of scripts that should go in separate files include:
  -Pretty much anything Jira related
  -Any function, and any scripts that are long enough that they may aswell be their own function.

*The coffee folder is not necessary, I just created it so that the example.coffee wouldn't get run
